Note:
I am currently deciding if North Korea can be mentioned or not, I think it should be a set of hidden levels that have some Easter Egg that activates them.
When this is done, it has to fit the puzzle theme, and cannot have North Korean citizens dying to the Regime, it has to be more friendly, even though being friendly is definitely not North Koreas thing.
With that, I am still questioning if it should even be added. Maybe a mission to disarm Nuclear missiles? I don't want this game to focus on Korean politics.
