Note:
References to Nazi germany and World War I Germany will only be accessible as add-ons, they cannot be in the actual game by default.
Add-ons may have to get modified to be allowed into Germany, swastikas will have to be replaced with something else. The add-on also cannot IN ANY WAY glorify, defend, or promote Adolf Hitler, other Nazi figures, and Nazism in general. It also cannot defend Germanys actions in World War I. That is NOT what this game is about.
I am leaving this in as a historical idea, so that you can rescue Jewish Mokis, and do other missions.
