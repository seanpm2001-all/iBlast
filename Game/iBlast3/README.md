# README - iBlast 3

This is the fan-made 3rd part, which will have more puzzles, elements, levels, and more. It will be an unofficial successor to iBlast Moki 2.

I will be writing this project in Python, but I will offer it in other languages when needed.

It is also going to have more platforms it will run on, besides Android and iOS, which include:

> Windows 7

> Windows 8.1

> Windows 10

> MacOS (10.8-10.16, 11.0-11.0)

> Ubuntu Linux (16.04 and up) along with Ubuntu flavors such as Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, and Edubuntu

> Fedora Linux (23 and up)

> Arch Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Manjaro Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Gentoo Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Artix Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Debian Linux (8.0 and up)

> RedHat Linux (7.0 and up)

> Other platforms (not mentioned... yet)

It will also still run on Android and iOS:

> Android 7.0 and up

> iOS 11 and up (64 bit version only)
