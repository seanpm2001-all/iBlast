# README - iBlast 2

This is the recreation center for iBlast Moki 2 (2011) which hasn't been updated in nearly a decade. As such, support for the program has ceased and won't run on devices running Android 7.0 (Nougat) and up, or devices running iOS 11 and up. For reference, there were 4 major versions of Android that have gone through development since then, and 3 versions of iOS that have also gone through development.

This game just won't run anymore. The original game had some bad bugs as well that would cause the program to crash, I would like to make this version a lot more stable.

If you want to listen to the soundtrack again, you can find it here (when I went to get the soundtrack, it wasn't on YouTube, so I bought it)

Please note, the soundtrack says iBlast Moki 2, but tracks 7-9 contain the original tracks from the first game.

I will be writing this project in Python, but I will offer it in other languages when needed.

It is also going to have more platforms it will run on, besides Android and iOS, which include:

> Windows 7

> Windows 8.1

> Windows 10

> MacOS (10.8-10.16, 11.0-11.0)

> Ubuntu Linux (16.04 and up) along with Ubuntu flavors such as Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, and Edubuntu

> Fedora Linux (23 and up)

> Arch Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Manjaro Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Gentoo Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Artix Linux (unknown ver and up)

> Debian Linux (8.0 and up)

> RedHat Linux (7.0 and up)

> Other platforms (not mentioned... yet)

It will also still run on Android and iOS:

> Android 7.0 and up

> iOS 11 and up (64 bit version only)
